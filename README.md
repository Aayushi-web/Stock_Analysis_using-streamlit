# Stock Analysis using Streamlit

This project utilizes Streamlit to create an interactive web application for stock analysis. The app allows users to analyze stock data, perform CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) analysis, and predict future stock prices using machine learning models.

## Features

- **Stock Analysis Page**: Provides detailed stock data visualizations, including historical stock prices, trends, and indicators like moving averages.
- **CAPM Analysis**: Implements CAPM to calculate the expected return of a stock based on its relationship with the market.
- **Stock Prediction**: Uses machine learning models to predict the future stock prices based on historical data.
- **Interactive Web Application**: Built using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface that allows users to input stock tickers and view dynamic charts and predictions.

## Video Demonstration

A video tutorial has been created to demonstrate the functionalities of the app, including:

- **Stock Analysis Page**: Exploring the interactive visualizations and insights from stock data.
- **CAPM Analysis**: Understanding the risk and return of a stock using the Capital Asset Pricing Model.
- **Stock Prediction**: How machine learning models are used to forecast stock prices.

# Stock Analysis using Streamlit

This project utilizes Streamlit to create an interactive web application for stock analysis. The app allows users to analyze stock data, perform CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) analysis, and predict future stock prices using machine learning models.

## Features

- **Stock Analysis Page**: Provides detailed stock data visualizations, including historical stock prices, trends, and indicators like moving averages.
- **CAPM Analysis**: Implements CAPM to calculate the expected return of a stock based on its relationship with the market.
- **Stock Prediction**: Uses machine learning models to predict the future stock prices based on historical data.
- **Interactive Web Application**: Built using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface that allows users to input stock tickers and view dynamic charts and predictions.

## Video Demonstration

A video tutorial has been created to demonstrate the functionalities of the app, including:

- **Stock Analysis Page**: Exploring the interactive visualizations and insights from stock data.
- **CAPM Analysis**: Understanding the risk and return of a stock using the Capital Asset Pricing Model.
- **Stock Prediction**: How machine learning models are used to forecast stock prices.

## Installation

Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
cd Stock_Analysis_using-Streamlit
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy
streamlit run app.py
This will start the app in your browser.

Requirements
streamlit

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

yfinance

scikit-learn

You can install all required libraries by running the following command:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stock_Analysis_using-Streamlit.git

How It Works
1. Stock Analysis Page
The Stock Analysis page displays historical stock prices, trends, and key financial indicators. It allows users to select a stock ticker, view price charts, and analyze trends. The page includes features like:

Stock price visualizations (line charts, candlestick charts)

Moving averages

Historical performance comparisons with other stocks

2. CAPM Analysis
CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) is used to estimate the expected return of a stock. The app computes the expected return based on the stock's beta (risk factor) and the expected market return. The key calculations include:

Expected Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate)

Beta calculation: A measure of the stock's volatility relative to the market.

3. Stock Prediction
Stock prediction is performed using machine learning models that analyze historical stock data. The models make predictions based on past trends and market behavior. Users can input the stock ticker, and the app will predict the future stock prices using algorithms such as:

Linear Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forests

The prediction results are displayed on an interactive chart for easy comparison with actual stock prices.
